# Runners deployed with permissions boundary 

This modules shows how to create GitHub action runners with permissions boundaries and paths used in role, policies, and instance profiles.

## Usages

Steps for the full setup, such as creating a GitHub app can be find the module [README](../../README.md). First create the deploy role and boundary policies. This steps required an admin user.

```bash
cd setup
terraform init
terraform apply
cd ..
```

After the apply a new role and policies are created, the state of the first step is imported in this workspace to load the role and policy. The deployment of the runner module is first assuming the new role before creating all resources. Before running Terraform, ensure the GitHub app is configured. 

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```
