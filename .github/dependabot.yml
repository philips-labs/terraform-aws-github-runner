# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.

# NPM production dependencies are part of the generated Lambda JavaScript.
# Therefore updates on production are prefixed with fix(component) to trigger releases.
# Development updates are prefixed with chore, and not triggering a release.
